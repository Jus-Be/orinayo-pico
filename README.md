# Orinayo

[![Build Status](https://github.com/Jus-Be/orinayo-pico/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Jus-Be/orinayo-pico/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Firmware for the **Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W** that acts as a Bluetooth-to-MIDI gateway, turning Bluetooth Classic (HID over L2CAP) and BLE devices into professional MIDI control surfaces. Connect wirelessly to your controller and output MIDI simultaneously over USB (to a DAW) and hardware UART (to a synthesizer).

## Features

- **Wireless input** — Bluetooth Classic (HID gamepads) and BLE MIDI devices
- **Dual MIDI output** — USB MIDI (TinyUSB) and UART MIDI (31,250 baud) simultaneously
- **Chord generation** — Button combinations map to chords via a 36-chord lookup table (12 roots × major/minor/sus)
- **32-step drum sequencer** — Record and play back patterns across 14 tracks with algorithmic ghost notes and fills
- **Tap tempo** — Set BPM by tapping the controller
- **Pattern persistence** — Looper patterns saved to flash and restored on power-up
- **Multiple operational modes** — Arranger, Ample Guitar VST, MIDI Drums, Yamaha SeqTrak, Yamaha MODX

## Supported Devices

### Bluetooth Input
| Device | Protocol |
|--------|----------|
| Guitar Hero-style controllers (CRKD-Gibson, etc.) | Bluetooth Classic HID |
| Liberlive BLE MIDI | BLE GATT |
| Sonic Master BLE MIDI | BLE GATT |
| Generic HID gamepads | Bluetooth Classic HID |

### MIDI Output
| Interface | Connection |
|-----------|------------|
| USB MIDI | USB cable to computer (DAW, etc.) |
| UART MIDI | GPIO 0 (TX) → 220 Ω resistor → 5-pin DIN circuit |

---

## Operational Modes

Select a mode at runtime using a button combination on the controller — no reflashing needed.

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Arranger** | Send chords and style-section commands to Ketron/Yamaha keyboard arrangers |
| **Ample Guitar** | Trigger guitar VST articulations and strumming modes via key switches |
| **MIDI Drums** | Record and play back drum patterns with 14 tracks, ghost notes, and fills |
| **SeqTrak** | Control Yamaha SeqTrak arpeggiator and pattern selection via SysEx |
| **MODX** | Control Yamaha MODX/Montage arpeggiator and scene changes via SysEx |

## Hardware Requirements

- **Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W** (RP2350 + CYW43439 — the Pico 2 W specifically, not Pico W)
- USB cable for power and USB MIDI
- A supported Bluetooth input device (see above)
- *(Optional)* 220 Ω resistors + 5-pin DIN connector for hardware UART MIDI output
- *(Optional)* GPIO buttons for looper record/play/tap-tempo control

## Quick Start

### Download Pre-built Firmware

The latest firmware is built automatically on every push via GitHub Actions.

1. Go to the [Actions tab](https://github.com/Jus-Be/orinayo-pico/actions)
2. Open the most recent successful **Build Orinayo** run
3. Download `workspace_artifacts.zip` and extract `Orinayo.uf2`
4. Hold **BOOTSEL** on the Pico 2 W while plugging in USB — it appears as **RPI-RP2**
5. Copy `Orinayo.uf2` to the **RPI-RP2** drive; the Pico reboots automatically
6. Pair your Bluetooth controller and connect a USB MIDI host or UART MIDI device

### Build from Source

```bash
# 1. Clone with submodules
git clone https://github.com/Jus-Be/orinayo-pico.git
cd orinayo-pico
git submodule update --init --recursive

# 2. Set Pico SDK path
export PICO_SDK_PATH=/path/to/pico-sdk

# 3. Build
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)

# 4. Flash Orinayo.uf2 to the Pico 2 W
```

Build artifacts (`Orinayo.uf2`, `.elf`, `.bin`, `.hex`) are placed in the `build/` directory.
